            Tim Flach is known for his captivating and thought-provoking images of the animal kingdom. He captures both the power and vulnerability of animals, highlighting their undeniable connection with humans and transporting audiences to a new visual perspective on wildlife and conservation.

            Flach has five main bodies of work which have been exhibited worldwide, including Museums of Natural History, from Paris to Beijing. He has seven international award-winning books, translated into multiple languages.

            Equus (2008) explores the family of creatures from Ass to Zebra, but is primarily horses.

            DogsGods (2010) focuses on the ever-changing relationship between dogs and humans through the diversity of dog breeds.

            More Than Human (2012) illuminates the ethical, scientific and political debates that surround our relationships with the natural world.

            Evolution (2013) is an anthology charting a visual journey from jellyfish and insects to birds and land animals.

            Endangered (2017) juxtaposes images with narratives, highlighting the harsh realities species face on the edge of extinction.

            Who am I? (2019) is a children’s book adapted from Endangered. It introduces young readers to the plight of ten species at risk of extinction.

            Birds (2021) begins with Archaeopteryx, a feathered dinosaur that connects us to the origins of modern birds. This is followed by flightless birds, more specialised species such as hummingbirds and finally poultry, domesticated and shaped by us. The book is informed by his research into how empathy can lead to pro-environmental outcomes, sharing his subject’s beauty, character and personality.

            Tim has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the Arts London (Norwich) and an Honorary Fellowship by the Royal Photographic Society.
